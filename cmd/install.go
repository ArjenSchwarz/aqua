It will download the latest version from GitHub, and install it as a Lambda
function with the name you specify.

Due to potential security risks, Aqua will always be installed with API keys
being required.

Before you do this, you first have to ensure you have an IAM role with all the
required permissions. You can use the following command to create such a role:

aqua role create --role role_name --type aqua

Example:
aqua install --name aqua -role aquarole
`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		filePath = "https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/aqua/releases/download/latest/aqua.zip"
		apikeyRequired = true
		buildGateway(cmd, args)
	},
}

func init() {
	RootCmd.AddCommand(installCmd)
}
